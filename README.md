# screenshot-text-extractor
A program that uses Curl to send a screenshot  you take in post request to the OCRspace free OCR  API  and returns the text inside the terminal  warning : since this is a free API sometimes the post request returns Null or it says that the request was not successful, Nothing is wrong with code (I think :) )it is just the API not working properly sometimes. "
I'm planning to use another API in the future like the google clould but this works for now.
